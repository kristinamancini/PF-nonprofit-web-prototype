The Piatigorsky Foundation is a nonprofit organization that encourages and introduces different communities to the beauty of classical music. A group of 6 students, including myself, collaborated in implementing a new design for the nonprofit's website, starting from wireframes built with Adobe XD and producing a functional website using a Bootstrap template. We provided a design that could be used for their future website.
